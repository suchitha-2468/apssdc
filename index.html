               <h4>Cabbage</h4>
               <span>Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple or white.
                Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common.
                Smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors are rarer.
                Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large.
                As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138.25 lb).</span>
